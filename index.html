			<p>Is it possible to live without traveling? Probably yes, but very difficult. Millions of people travel around the world just for fun. Travels broaden the mind, make a person be more friendly and open. Journeys could be made in different ways. You might travel by plane, by bus, by rail or by your own car.</p>
			<br>
			<p>As for me, I'm just crazy about travelling by sea. I believe that this voyage gives you a lot of unforgettable emotions and impressions. If you make for the open sea by ferry, in this case you have a wonderful opportunity to see the depth of the sea, the purity of water and living marine animals in all their beauty. Besides, a good opportunity arises - swimming in pure water. Nevertheless, I don’t like jellyfish too much and at any case try to avoid their presence.</p>
